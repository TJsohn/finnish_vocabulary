# Task 3: Finnish Vocabulary Flashcard App

Our Laravel task from REACT25K is to extend the “name color manager” app into Finnish vocabulary flashcard app using finnfast.fi API. The goal of the task is to use external API integration, add a simple game-like feature (flashcards) to learn Finnish words and keep the Laravel backend to user-specific data.

## Task Description

Our job is to modify the Name and Color Manager app to:

1. Fetch Finnish words from the finnfast.fi API and display them as flashcards in the React app.
2. Allow users to save favorite words to the Laravel backend (new words table and API).
3. Add a simple toggle to switch between the existing “Name-Color” form and the new “Flashcard” view.
4. Retain Blade routes (/blade) for the original app

### Result

-   Achieved to make both apps working and especially fetching Finnish Vocabulary data and making it a flashcard app: It had limitations to fetch data in a free plan, so I had to sign up with another email to film how it works.
